    <p>James Patrick Higgins, 76, passed away just before dawn on January&nbsp;22, 2025, at his home in Sherman&nbsp;Oaks, California.</p>

    <p>James, who preferred “Jimmy” in the first and last few decades of his life, was born in Pawcatuck, Connecticut in 1949. He was the son of Johnny and Rita Higgins, who predeceased him, and brother to Michael&nbsp;Higgins and Janice&nbsp;Higgins&nbsp;Rissler. He attended Fairfield&nbsp;University before moving to the Los&nbsp;Angeles area with The&nbsp;Repairs&nbsp;Band.</p>

    <p>Jimmy was relentlessly creative, as a musician and singer from his high school years, and as a gifted writer who loved refining and perfecting his short stories, several of which saw publication in local collections. He was an ardent supporter of causes he held dear, including the environment, the arts, and access to education. He believed strongly in our duty and ability to leave a better world to our children. He was a brilliant communicator and always able to find a joke.</p>

    <p>Above all, he was devoted to his wife Jill&nbsp;Tate&nbsp;Higgins, his family, and the friends he could not help but make wherever he went. He joked often about being “outnumbered” by the children he lovingly raised. He is survived by those children, including Emily&nbsp;Capurro, Michelle&nbsp;McFarland, Parker&nbsp;Higgins, Ivy&nbsp;Castillo, Spencer&nbsp;Higgins, Annie&nbsp;Higgins, and Tucker&nbsp;Higgins; as well as five grandchildren who knew him as “Boompa”; and many more individuals to whom he provided fatherly support, guidance, and camaraderie. He will be sorely missed.</p></div>
